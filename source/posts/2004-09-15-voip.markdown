This week I've been busy with Asterisk.
Arthur from TIM_Online really believes that Voice Over IP is thÃ© next big thing and that big bucks can be earned with it. So I started fidling with it.

The developers of Asterisk say:

>"Asterisk is a complete PBX in software. It runs on Linux and provides all of the features you would expect from a PBX and more. Asterisk does voice over IP in three protocols, and can interoperate with almost all standards-based telephony equipment using relatively inexpensive hardware."

I say: Asterisk is a bitch to configure. I can't get it to work. And I didn't even look at the 'advanced' options.

I really think it has potential, especially the 'SIP' protocol. I suggest you take a look at gnomemeeting and SJphone. Both are nice clients and work with H.323 as well as SIP. Both run on linux but SJphone is available as a really nice windows client too.
