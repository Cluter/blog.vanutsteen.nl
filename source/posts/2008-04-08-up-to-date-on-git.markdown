[![Github](/images/uploads/2008/04/sinatra.png)](/images/uploads/2008/04/sinatra.png)I've been using GIT now some weeks (for my [ultra-secret ruby project](https://github.com/LeonB/jruby_gst/)) and I must say it's nice. Nothing more than nice. Just like svn was nice to use (compared to old-school full backups). When I first saw the GIT commands I was dazzling with confusion. But after two days you get the hang of it. I haven't done anything special like branching so I can't tell you about the advanced features. But the base is solid.

Ow, and github is really nice. I read somewhere that rubyforge now has git support too. Gonna check that out. But beating github will be difficult. Well, at least for now when Github is still free of charge!
