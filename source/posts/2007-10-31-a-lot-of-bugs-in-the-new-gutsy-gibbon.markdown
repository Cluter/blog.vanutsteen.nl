There are a lot of bugs in the new Ubuntu Gutsy gibbon. For example:  

https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-power-manager/+bug/41994

I encoutered on my laptop. But also my server-install of Ubuntu encoutered some bugs.Even one in the apache2 package! And one in the firehol package that was open since Feisty Fawn. So my verdict: some nice new features, but more new bugs.

I know, I'm not upgrading my live server to Gutsy.
