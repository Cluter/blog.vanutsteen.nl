I saw that there are python bindings for libindicate. They're called "[python-indicate](https://launchpad.net/indicator-applet)".

There's also a wiki about this [new feature from Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MessagingMenu/). I thought about creating a plugin for weechat that uses this library. Especially because the notify-plugins is useless if you're away and somebody mentions you on irc. Libindicate would be perfect for this. First have to find out how the behaviour of the applet would be.

[update]
I asked my question on the [libindicate launchpad](https://answers.launchpad.net/indicator-applet/+question/86361) so I'm very curious about the answer(s).
