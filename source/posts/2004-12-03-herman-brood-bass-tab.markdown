Some time ago, I posted this news item. I told that mxtabs suck because they rejected my tab of Herman Brood's song Saturday night. 

I didn't find it fair because I thought my tab was all right. But last week I tried to play the tab I made for the bass together with a friend. And it sounded like shit. I didn't made sense at all. When I played it alone, it sounded just like the reel number. But now... Even when I play along the original number on cd it just doesn't sound right. So, I'm not so mad anymore that mxtabs rejected my tab. But I am mad at the person who voted against me. I don't think he even ever heard of Herman Brood... But alla
