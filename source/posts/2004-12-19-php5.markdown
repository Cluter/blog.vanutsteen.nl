Last week I installed PHP5. I was a bit afraid I would get all sorts of errors in combination with Mambo. And I got them. PHP was giving me errors that sessions wouldn't work. At first I thought it was a rights issue. 

But after some investigation it looked like I compiled php without the Use Flag ([Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org)) 'session'. So after I re-compiled it, it was fixed.
Gallery and Mambo now both work. Maybe I'll try to code something myself with the OO-features of PHP5.
