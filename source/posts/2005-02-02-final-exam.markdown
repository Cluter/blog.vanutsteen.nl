Last friday I had my final exam  where I had to defend my project at Tim_online. I presented the implementationplan I wrote and after that I had to answer the questions of the comission in an assesment. The comission existed of two teachers and an external expert. 
It went fairly well and my efforts got positively rewarded. So 16 february I can pick up my diploma. 

To celebrate my victory I treated everyone some pastry. And after this new blog item is done, I' m going home to try out my new X-box I got from Tim_online. As present for succesfully completing my internship!

The coming six months I'll keep on working at Tim_online. And after that six months: probably a new study. I' m only 21 years old and a new study would be a nice challenge.
