Thursday I started searching the internet for tutorials on how to program object oriënted in PHP.
I found some tutorials, but I still find it very difficult to grep the why of object oriënted programming.
So if you know a good book or better, a good tutorial on OOP. Please let me now!

I'm thinking of installing the new PHP5. With it's better support for OOP it might push me in the right direction.
