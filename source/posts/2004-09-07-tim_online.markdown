Last week school started and this half year should be my last half year at (this) school. This half year I have a training period at a little company called TIM_online.
At the end of the period I have to write a couple of reports, but that's to boring to explain on this site.

I'm now developing the new website for TIM. But you can read more about that in the blog of tim-online. Also check my blog about design.

I'll try to keep you informed about the progress and when I have a task description I'll update the news.
