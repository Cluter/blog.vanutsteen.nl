The new Gnome 2.8 is out for a couple of days now. I wanted to install it, but I keep hearing it has a lot of bugs still in it.

I tried to install evolution and that worked. But not (yet) the Exchange connectivity. Too bad, because I really need an email client that works with Exchange.

I'll go back to 1.4.6 and will wait for a couple of weeks before I try again. But 1.4.6 doesn't look as nice as 2.0 does.
