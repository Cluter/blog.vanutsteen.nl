I've been implementing the `opengraph` protocol for my blog post pages. I wanted to be sure I implemented it right and searched for tools that could help me with this task. I came up with the folowing two:

* [Opengraph Linter](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug)
* [Google Rich snippet tool](http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets)

When running a post through the Opengraph linter it came up that `og:image` must have a absolute url. Relative urls are not supported.

Some other links on the opengraph protocol:
