[![](/images/uploads/2008/04/let-x.jpg)](/images/uploads/2008/04/let-x.jpg)Wordpress is a great blog application. It has some nice free templates and the default installation has everything I need without being bloated. I miss one thing: automatic resizing of images who are too big. So I plan on making it myself. Something like [this](http://www.vestaldesign.com/blog/2007/10/wordpress-image-resizer-plugin.html) but even simpler (as well in functionality as in configurability).
