OK, the site is live now (again). After picking a Content Management System, learning CSS, making a template and refreshing my php-skills the difficult part is yet to come: placing content and keeping the site up-to-date.

And what content should I place? It has to attract visitors, keep them coming. Some ideas up till now:

* Photo's;
* Blog;
* Curiculum Vitae / Resum√©;
* Todo list;
* Something about myself;
* Etc...

If you would like to see something else appear on this site: mail me! I have truly no idea what to write about.
Keep an eye on this site because I'm still busy tidying this site.
