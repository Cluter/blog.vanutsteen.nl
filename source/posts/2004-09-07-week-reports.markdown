Last week I started my new job at TIM as I have mentioned in one of my previous posts.

Schools demands that you write a report every week where you track your progress, evaluate the planning you've made etcetera. So, this is week two and I'm already a week behind. And now I'm writing an article while I should work on the report.

I'm looking at my bass guitar (just bought it a couple of weeks ago) which is asking to play on it. I want to add some new sections to this site which I'm planning to do for a couple of weeks now. 

I'll get started right now and I'll write a nice article tomorrow. Maybe something about bass playing.
