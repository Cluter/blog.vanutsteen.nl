Well, you really notice it's Christmas. No news at all on the Internet!

Everybody's celebrating Christmas and nobody’s placing anything new on the web. Well, I do. But I’m not sane. I tried to satisfy my need for news on several different sites. But it’s what they call in the Netherlands: “komkommertijd”. And when it’s komkommertijd, it means there’s no news, and the news there is, doesn’t deserve to be called news.

I think there’s nothing else for me to do, than to go and celebrate Christmas. Happy Christmas everyone!
