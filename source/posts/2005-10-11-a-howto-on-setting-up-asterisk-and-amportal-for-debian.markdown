For a long time I wanted to install Asterisk on my debian server. I installed it once, with the default debian packages but that wasn’t to my likings. So here is a guide for everyone who wants to use Asterisk in combination with Amportal.

My main goal was to use as much as default debian packages as possible. Because they will be automatically updated and I don’t have to think about security updates and stuff.

I divided this howto in 17 steps. I think it’s quite straightforward, but if you are having problems with it, please contact me at leon@tim-online.nl
