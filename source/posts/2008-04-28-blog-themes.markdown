[![](/images/uploads/2008/04/cultfoo1.jpg)](/images/uploads/2008/04/cultfoo1.jpg)I'm not a designer _at_all_ but [this post](http://www.blogdesignblog.com/blog-design/how-to-blog-design-style-guide) on designing a blog theme is very nice. I really like the copyblogger theme I have now. But maybe I'll try and create something myself. Because a unique theme for a blog is so much nicer.

Also [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/04/23/5-principles-and-ideas-of-setting-type-on-the-web/) a post on typography and [five principles of effective web design](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/04/24/5-more-principles-of-effective-web-design/).
