I'm so tired that Firefox keeps crashing with every shitty Flash movie out there. But... today I read an alpha version of [Flash Player 10 with 64 bit suppport (for Linux)](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/releasenotes_64bit.html) is out. Click the link and download the archive an install it (drop flashplayer.so in ~/.mozilla/plugins).

And so far (*knock *knock) I haven't had A SINGLE CRASH. And all movies I've seen so far look ok!

Ow, before installing the version from Adobe, make sure you've uninstalled the Ubuntu flash plugin with:

```
sudo aptitude remove flashplugin-nonfree nspluginwrapper
```

Good job Adobe! And I've ordered a [book on Flex ](http://www.bol.com/nl/p/boeken-engels/learning-flex-3/1001004006183209/index.html)which should arive any day now so I'm totally into Adobe now :)
