I'm reading a lot about git lately. Supposedly it's the next greatest revision control software. It's faster, better and doesn't take the _enormous_ amount of space subversion does. Maybe I'll try it anytime soon but I don't see any obvious advantages for using git over subversion.

I think using git's a lot more trouble. Does capistrano work? Where am I going to host my project? Does netbeans support git? Is there enough git documentation for dumb people like me?
