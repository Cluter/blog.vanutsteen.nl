One one the biggest thing I miss in Gnome is a good clipboard manager. Ever tried to copy something from Firefox and the closed firefox? What happened? Right! The copied piece is gone. Pfff..... 

How to solve it:

``` bash
sudo apt-get install glipper
```

That's all. Maybe there are some better clipboard managers but glipper worked off the shelf.
