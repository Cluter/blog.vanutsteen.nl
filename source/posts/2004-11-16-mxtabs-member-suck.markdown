As you know I play bass guitar. If I want to play a new song I get the tab from MXtabs.
But there as no existing tab for saturday night from Herman Brood. So I submitted my tab for Herman Brood's Saturday Night to MXtabs. But some guy called SabathSlayer666 (wooohhhh...) disapproved it! The only tabs he submitted are Iron Maiden tabs. I think he's a fourteen-year-old kid.

But enough nagged. If I can't place it there, I'll place it on my own site. So click on "Read more..." if you are interested in my first self-written bass tab.

```
Song : Saturday Night
Band : Herman Brood & his wild romance
Album : ?

Comment:
I don't think my tab is completely correct at all. So, if anyone has some corrections: go ahead and submit them!
