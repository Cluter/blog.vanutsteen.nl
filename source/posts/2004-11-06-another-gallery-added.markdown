Today I tried to add another gallery to mambo. This gallery is called: gallery. A verry original name but it is a nice piece of software. You can find it at:
http://gallery.sourceforge.net

First I installed gallery, which you can see at:
http://gallery.vanutsteen.nl

Then, I wanted to add it to mambo as a module. But it didn't really work. It was a version from CVS so it's possible it was broken. I'm now going to a dinner sow I try to install the new version tomorrow. Bye
