I recently upgrade my Wordpress installation to 2.5.1 and this [annoying bug](http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6406) showed up. After some reading I installed the [no-flash-uploader](http://trac.wordpress.org/attachment/ticket/6406/no-flash-uploader.php) plugin. This plugin disables the faulty (flash) component and replaces it with a traditional uploader. So now I can upload my files again. But it is rather annoying. And I think more people would [agree with me](http://trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6406#comment:7).
