A new project for Mambo has been started: OpenSEF. The company Xaneon has opensourced it's SEF component for Mambo. It's still a b√®ta version, but soon the stable version will be released.

I installed it and expected it to work right out of the box. But that wasn't true. My old stories aren't SEF'ed and I have to 'alias' them myself. But that's too much work, so I'll try now to make it work automagically.

<some time later>
Ah, I now know how it works. It generates the automatic aliases the first time when you click on a link. Excellent!
