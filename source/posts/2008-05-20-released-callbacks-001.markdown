Hi all! I've released [my first project on rubyforge](http://callbacks.rubyforge.org/). The [sourcecode is on github](http://github.com/LeonB/callbacks) though. For theÂ  simple reason that my git repository on rubyforge doesn't work (yet). I hope they will [fix it soon](http://rubyforge.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=20229&group_id=5&atid=102).

I've setup the project with the wonderful [bones of Tim Pease](http://codeforpeople.rubyforge.org/bones/).

I've got some reasonable documentation about it, a kick-ass website (stolen from [Dr. Nic's newgem](http://newgem.rubyforge.org/)) and some nice unit tests. I'm now integrating the gem in one of my own projects. If that's succesfull I'm gonna release a version 0.1. The version after 0.1 will have new features.

The website ws generated with [webby](http://webby.rubyforge.org). A really nice way to create static websites in ruby. Maybe I'll dedicate a post/tutorial to webby.

So please look at the website, install the gem and give me some feedback. It will be very appreciated!
