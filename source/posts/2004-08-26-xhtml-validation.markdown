I was so proud of the XHTML validation about this site that I placed a link to the W3C validatior in the footer.
But I didn't realise that Mambo doesn't generate valid XHTML though. At least not until version 5.0. So until the content of this site is not going to be validated. The layout and the CSS file however are still valid.
