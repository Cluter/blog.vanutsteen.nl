With my fabulous new project: mpd_radio I'm trying to everything right: tests, documentation, the whole shebang. So I was surfing tonight for some tutorials on rdoc. But I couldn't find a lot. Some useful links:



	
  * [Rdoc markup documentation
](http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html)

	
  * [ Introduction to Rdoc](http://toolmantim.com/article/2007/4/19/introduction_to_rdoc)


When I learn some more about it I'll post it here!
