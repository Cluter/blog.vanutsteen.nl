Hi! Welcome! Don't go away... :(

Why there's so little news on this site you ask? Well, here's the answer: I don't know if anyone visites this site. What kind of public. What they're interested about. I've got a lot to write about. But I must pick a subject.
Maybe I can add some pictures to this site? Yes, but the problem is the damn gallery script won't work with asterisk. Maybe some day tomorrow I will install the new version and publish some of my exciting (cough) pictures. But is that enough to attract new visitors? No, I don't think so. It's nice for my dad who occasionaly visits this site. I must make my site better than other similar sites.

I think, I can make my site better than other (personal) sites by publishing some information no other site has. So I was thinking about writing a detailed story about my findings with asterisk. If you don't know what asterisk is: doesn't matter. Just mail me! And tell me I have to write a story about it. Else I just keep forgetting about it. It's just lazyness.

And another target I created for myself is to publish more personal news about me. Just like I diary. I don't care who's visiting this site. Right?.....
