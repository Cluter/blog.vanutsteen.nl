**A.k.a. "installing something that would take ages in another OS"**

For a client of [ours](http://www.tim-online.nl) I'm doing a project. But I had to wait at my new house today for my new tiles. And at my new address I don't have internet yet. So I made a local copy of the project and had to install apache, mysql and phpmyadmin.

```
sudo aptitude install libapache2-mod-php5 phpmyadmin mysql-server apache2 php5-gd
```

And it worked! Linux not user-friendly? Pfffttt!
