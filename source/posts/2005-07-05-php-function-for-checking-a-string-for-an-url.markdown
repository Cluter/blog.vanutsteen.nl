Hi, 
Under the link "read more" you can find a self-written function that checks a string for url's. 
I don't know what to say more. I think it explains itself. It is very simple and I tried to make it as fast as possible.

It first checks the string for simple things like 'http' and 'www'. After that it searches the string for a topleveldomain with a point in front of it.
So, the string: 'vanutsteen.nl' will be recognized as an url. 

If anybody has any suggestions to make it better, I will be glad to hear them.
