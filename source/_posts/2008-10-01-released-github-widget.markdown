[![](http://www.vanutsteen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/github_logo.png)](http://www.vanutsteen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/github_logo.png)I think you all noticed my fabulous new sidebar widget: My projects :P

It shows _all_ of my github projects. I directly turned it into a plugin for you to enjoy. You can download and read the documentation in the [wordpress plugin directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/github-widget/).
