I was surfing for some ticketing / project management software and it returned the following result:



	
  * [Sifter](http://nextupdate.com)

	
  * [Beanstalk](http://beanstalkapp.com)

	
  * [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org)

	
  * [Unfuddle](http://unfuddle.com)

	
  * [Lighthouse](http://www.lighthouseapp.com)

	
  * [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)

	
  * [16 bugs](http://16bugs.com)

	
  * [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/)

	
  * [Fogbugz](http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBUGZ)

	
  * [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org)


Especially Sifter looks really nice! But... it isn't open source. So too bad. I went with Redmine: open source, ruby on rails and already a nice feature set!

A nice overview of bug/issue tracking systems can be found on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue_tracking_systems).
