I'm starting with Python/GtkBuilder and I wanted a nice IDE for Python. Because I really like using netbeans for coding ruby, I gave it a try for python. But the support for python is still alpha. :(

For it to work you have to download the [latest (nightly) netbeans build](http://bits.netbeans.org/download/trunk/nightly/latest/) and the [netbeans python plugin(s)](http://bits.netbeans.org/download/trunk/nightly/latest/)
