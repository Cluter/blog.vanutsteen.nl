In ubuntu 11.04 I had an [icon](http://ramzea.deviantart.com/art/Ubuntu-Mono-Parcellite-Icon-161002817) at ~/.icons/Humanity/status/22/gtk-paste.svg so I would get a nice systray icon for [ClipIt](http://clipit.rspwn.com/). But ClipIt changed something so now I had to cp the gtk-paste.svg to:

~/.icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/clipit-trayicon.svg

Then logout/login and I had a nice [trayicon](http://ramzea.deviantart.com/art/Ubuntu-Mono-Parcellite-Icon-161002817)! Long live clipboard managers. I _really_ wouldn't want to miss them!
