![monty-python](http://www.vanutsteen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/monty-python.jpg)I've ditched [Ruby for my mpd project](http://github.com/LeonB/rmpd) and started using Python. Not that I like python that much more but the Gstreamer library for python is much more complete. I really wanted gapless playback and the Ruby Gstreamer libray just doesn't support that. If it does by the time you read this: please let me know :)

The new Pmpd project (looking for a better name) can be found on [github](http://github.com/LeonB/pmpd). The hardest part so far is having to restructure the sources. Python is not a difficult language to master at all but I'm very picky on how everything fits together. My ruby project felt right on that part. But the python equivelant has some things I just don't like enough up to now.
