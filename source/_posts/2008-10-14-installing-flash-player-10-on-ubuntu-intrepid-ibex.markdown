![](http://www.vanutsteen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/flash_player_10.jpg)I wanted to install flash player 10 because flash player nine kept crashing on my Ubuntu 8.10 installation. So I found a nice [howto](http://www.myscienceisbetter.info/2008/05/install-adobe-flash-player-10-on-ubuntu-using-nspluginwrapper.html) on google an followed it. The article explains how to install it on a 64 bit installation of the Ubuntu operating system.

The howto worked fine, but flash kept crashing. I think it has something to do with the nspluginwrapper package.

[edit]
Flash 10 is now the default install, so this post is no longer needed!
