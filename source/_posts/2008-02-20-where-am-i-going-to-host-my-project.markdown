In my previous blog item I asked the question: where am I going to host my (git) project? [John Nunemaker](http://railstips.org) mentioned [github](http://github.com) for hosting git projects. Maybe I'm gonna look at that when I'm [done with my house](http://gallerij.vanutsteen.nl/v/admin/verbouwing/).
