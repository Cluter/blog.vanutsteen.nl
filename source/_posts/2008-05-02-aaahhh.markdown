[![](http://www.vanutsteen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/coax1-300x124.jpg)](http://www.vanutsteen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/coax1.jpg)30 April was queens day (?) and 1 may was labourday /Â  Ascension Day. So I didn't have to go to work. But when I came home (I live 100km from my work or so) I noticed I forgot to pack the adapter of my notebook. I had 1,5 hours of power left. So I checked my mail and hibernated it. *Sigh* two days without hacking any software... And to make things worse. I now have my adapter back, but I was stupid enough to rip the coax to pieces. After work, first stop: hardware store! I must have Internet tonight!
