As a "professional" webdesigner I know how much testing sucks and how it, at the same time, is one of the most important things to do (besides coding the stuff). That's why I appreciate Rails' very complete testsuite so much. And now with Rspec user stories (a nice tutorial [here](http://andrzejonsoftware.blogspot.com/2008/01/rspec-user-story-example.html) and [here](http://evang.eli.st/blog/2007/9/1/user-stories-with-rspec-s-story-runner)) and [webrat](http://www.benmabey.com/2008/02/04/rspec-plain-text-stories-webrat-chunky-bacon/) it's getting even better!
