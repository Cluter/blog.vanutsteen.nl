![](/images/uploads/2008/04/purple_heron-245x300.jpg)Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron) is released. And they have already provided some [netboot/mini images](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hardy/main/) too. I was looking for the jeos images. But that [mirror](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/jeos/releases/) seems down.

Nice! Ubuntu rocks!
