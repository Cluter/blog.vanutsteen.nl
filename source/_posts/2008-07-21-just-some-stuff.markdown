![](http://www.vanutsteen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/brightbox_logo.jpg)Just some quick links!

This links describes [how to manage multiple databases with Capistrano](http://shanesbrain.net/2007/5/30/managing-database-yml-with-capistrano-2-0). That's not why I picked it though. I liked it because it shows the "<<: *" syntax of yaml.

And a repository of Ubuntu Hardy Heron [debs for mod_rails/Phusion passenger](http://blog.brightbox.co.uk/tag/mod_rails). At this time I installed mod_rails via rubygems. But if the guys at brighbox make the package so it builds/installs the Apache module automatically (without human intervention and pressing Y two times) I will install that one. Much, much nicer to use with Puppet.
